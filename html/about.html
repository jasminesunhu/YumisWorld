        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Yumi!</p>
        <p>I have a background in software engineering, but growing up I've always loved arts and crafts.
            In 2022, I recieved a crochet making kit for christmas, and ever since then I have loved following
            online tutorials and have tried making plushies, coasters, pillows and more. Now I have started 
            evolving into creating my own works, which I want to share with you all! This is currently a passion
            project I do on the side of my full-time job, so I thank you for your patience, and feel free to 
            give me feedback! <br>
